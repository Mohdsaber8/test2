<h2 style="text-align: center;">Computing Department</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Design and implement web server and mobile applications. Apply mobile device programming techniques to web server interactions. The specification for both the server and the android app is presented below. Each section has been assigned a weighting to give you an idea of the relative importance of each tranche of functionality in the marking scheme. You will be marked on how much of the specification you have implemented overall, as evidenced by review of your submitted source code, and by viewing your submitted screencast.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Your Server/Web Service (40%)</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">You will implement your own RESTful web service in Java using HTTP Server which will accept client GET requests and return data in JSON format. The server will connect to a SQLite database that contains employee information (similar to the database from the first assignment) and return that data to the requesting clients. The default URL (http://localhost:8005/) should output all the employees’ information stored in the database. The classes used for the server implementation are illustrated in the following UML diagram:</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center"> Code and visual quality (10%></h2>
    <p>At a very minimum your app should display the name and email of all employees in the database. The better apps will have well thought out layout and style and display additional information to the user about the employees such as job title, salary etc. The overall look and design is up to you. The images/icons should be scaled appropriately, and the app should look reasonably well polished (sensibly laid out, readable text, standard contrasting text, icons and background colours colours). Your code should be sensibly designed, laid out consistently and well commented. </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">server</h2>
    <p>Include some way of adding new employee information to the database. This can be achieved by adding another route to the HTTP server (e.g. http://localhost:8005/add_emp) which outputs an html form that can be filled and submitted by the user. Once submitted the server will need an additional route (e.g. http://localhost:8005/process_emp) which will process the data submitted by the user through the html form and add it to the SQLite database. Android App The tasks of talking to the server to retrieve data can sometimes take some time to complete. Leaving your app’s interface locked up whilst it performs this task is hardly going to enhance the user experience! In addition to this making network calls on the main app thread is not desirable in the app development world. Improve matters by handling the network calls that retrieve the data from your java server using the AsyncTask class, which will perform them in a new thread in the background. Remember to remove the StrictMode workaround discussed in lectures once threading is working. </p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Web Services</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">The term Web service is either: a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web, or a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents</p>
